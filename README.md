This project is a Streamlit-based application that extracts and summarizes text from YouTube videos and web pages using LangChain. It supports Groq API (Gemma-7b-It) and Hugging Face API (Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3) for LLM-based summarization. Users can input a URL, and the app generates a concise summary. The project leverages YouTube and web page loaders for data extraction and provides a user-friendly interface for easy interaction.
